// a[3:0] represents a 4-bit bus. The bits, from most significant to least
// significant, are a[3], a[2], a[1], and a[0]. This is called little-endian
// order, because the least significant bit has the smallest bit number. We
// could have named the bus a[4:1], in which case a[4] would have been the most
// significant. Or we could have used a[0:3], in which case the bits, from most
// significant to least significant, would be a[0], a[1], a[2], and a[3]. This
// is called big-endian order.
